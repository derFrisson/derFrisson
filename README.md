### About

IT Administrator and Security Officer (ITSiBe) at [Off-Grid Europe](https://www.offgrideurope.com), where I keep the lights on — ironically, at a company that takes them off-grid. Responsible for infrastructure, IT security, and making sure we're compliant so auditors sleep well at night.

Outside of work, I run a hybrid homelab spanning colocated bare-metal and cloud VMs. Self-hosting everything I can, because trusting third parties is optional.

### What I Work With

```
Infrastructure     Docker · HAProxy · Nginx · GitHub Actions · CI/CD
Cloud & Hosting    Hetzner Cloud · Hetzner Colo · VPS
Networking         WireGuard · VPN Mesh · MikroTik · DNS
Security           TLS/SSL · Let's Encrypt · Zero-Trust Networking
Compliance         ISO 27001 · NIS2 · GDPR
Identity & Auth    Zitadel · OIDC · SAML
Monitoring         Prometheus · Grafana
OS                 Windows (Atlas OS) · Linux (servers)
Languages          Bash · YAML · HCL
```

### Current Projects

🛡️ **IT Security & Compliance** — Building and maintaining an ISMS aligned with ISO 27001 & NIS2, because "we'll fix it later" is not a security policy

🔧 **Automated HAProxy Builds** — CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, compiled with AWS-LC for modern TLS performance

🌐 **Hybrid Homelab** — Bare-metal colo + cloud VMs with mesh VPN connectivity under `frisson.social`

🔐 **Centralized Identity** — Zitadel as the single OIDC provider across all self-hosted services

📊 **Infrastructure Monitoring** — Prometheus exporters deployed across the full stack
